# Pythonista-UI-Templates
Provides blank `.pyui` files for all iOS device screen sizes. 

`ui-templater.py` is an editor action. Add it, then navigate to whatever project you're working on that needs a device-sized template. When you run the action, just choose a device, and you'll magically have a `.pyui` file of the appropriate size waiting for you.
